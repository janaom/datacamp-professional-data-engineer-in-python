# Using Docker Containers

You'll go from starting and stopping your first container to seeing how to clean your environment by removing all containers and images. You'll see how to debug issues by running commands inside a container or executing bash commands in a container interactively. All of this is done using the Docker Command Line Interface.

---------------------------------------

The Docker command line interface or CLI allows us to send instructions to the Docker daemon, which manages containers and images. The basic command is docker. To start a container, we need an image, which acts as a blueprint defining what will be available in the container. For example, the ubuntu image contains the full Ubuntu OS. When we start a container from this image, we get a running instance of Ubuntu that we can interact with via a shell. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0365ca6f-b893-40bf-9427-fd96d532e3e5)

If we want to start a container from an image, we can use the docker run command, followed by the image-name. To start the hello-world image, we would use docker run hello world. By default, Docker starts a container and shows you its output while it's running. When we run a hello-world container, it prints an explanation of how the container works and then stops. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9637f000-f751-432a-9b70-75051aa1cdee)

When an image is created, the creator can choose what happens when a container is started from the image. For example, the creators of the hello-world image chose to print out text and then make the container stop itself. Another example is the Ubuntu image. When starting an Ubuntu container, it will start and then shut down immediately without printing any output. Its creators decided it didn't make sense to output anything specific by default. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3785d9b2-a1a5-4629-bc6d-28d48c24c176)

Instead, the Ubuntu image is intended to be used with the dash it flag. Using 'docker run dash it' followed by an image-name, we can start a container and simultaneously get an interactive shell in this container. If we do this with the Ubuntu image, we get a new shell inside the new container. The shell gives us access to a clean Ubuntu environment isolated from our host machine because it runs inside the container. Once we want to exit the container, we simply use the exit command, which returns us to the host machine and then stops the container. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/131964eb-3dce-42c5-b780-e3974662ab12)

We saw a container that just prints text and one that makes more sense to use interactively. A third type of container processes data or can be interacted with in some way externally, for example, a container with a database like Postgres. These are run using Docker run dash d, for detached, followed by the image-name. These containers run in the background without printing their output to our shell. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65810e8d-2658-4384-812b-d12e9a835e7b)

The docker ps command allows us to see any running containers. The first column contains the container-id, uniquely identifying each container. The' docker stop' command can be used to stop containers we no longer need.

## Exercise: An interactive container

Another bug has popped up in the data ingestion pipeline; this time, however, you got some pointers on where the issue might be. Your colleagues tell you the application cannot start inside its Ubuntu container. To debug the issue you want to start an Ubuntu container and try to run the application yourself to find out what's going wrong.

Select the right combination of commands to:

    Run an ubuntu container and get an interactive shell inside of the container.
    Close the container to go back to the host after you got an interactive shell in the container and found the issue with the pipeline.

You can use the shell to try out the possible commands.

# Working with Docker containers

When there are only a few containers, it's easy to find them in the list that docker ps returns. However, if you're working with lots of containers, it can quickly become challenging to identify the right one.  To solve this, the docker run command has a name flag that allows us to name a container. The name then shows up in the last column of the docker ps output. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66bbab16-5ff6-4c06-bba8-65474dd0070d)

When using docker ps with so many containers that even naming them doesn't allow us to find them. We can use docker ps with the f, for filter flag to find a specific container. This will show you only the details of containers with the name you specified in the filter. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2213411-caaa-4320-927d-3683ad92d5cc)

Now that we know how to find our running containers, it will also be useful to see their output, for example, to debug any issues. To look at the output a container has generated, we can use the docker logs command followed by the container id. Most containers quickly generate a lot of output, so you will often have to scroll through the result of docker logs to find what you're looking for. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f100c453-421d-4f69-bae2-e77c3eb671ab)

If instead, you want to follow the logs your container is generating in real-time, you can use docker logs together with the f, for follow, flag. You will see any logs the container generates live. Even though docker ps also has a f flag, the docker ps flag allows us to filter. When working with docker logs instead, the f flag has another effect, allowing us to follow a container its logs. After using docker logs, you will see the output of a running container until either the end of the logs or until you press control plus c to exit the log view. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec07f94c-f1c8-474d-a22c-ab0827459b86)

Previously, we learned how to stop containers. However, a stopped container is not fully gone; the stopped container still exists and is occupying some space on our hard drive. To fully remove an already stopped container, for example, because we want to reuse its name, we use docker container rm followed by the container-id to remove the container. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e08896b4-a335-4f6f-a3ff-b24cc35e97f1)

## Exercise: Helping a colleague

You're working on a project of your own and have quite a few containers running when your colleague asks you to debug an issue he's having. You've got some time to help your colleague, but you want to make sure you can find his container among all the ones you already have running.


    Using the terminal, enter the command to run the my_project image detached from your shell while giving it the colleague_project name.
    To run an image in detached mode use the -d flag, without using this flag the image will run connected to your shell making it unusable. If this happens you can refresh the page.

    The container should be running now. Make sure it is by filtering the running containers using the name colleague_project you gave the container.

    Now that you're sure the container is running look at the logs using the container's name, colleague_project.

## Exercise: Cleaning up containers

You were able to find the issue with your colleague's container and help him fix it. Before you return to your project, you want to clean up the container you just started to help your colleague.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to stop the colleague_project container.

    Now that the container is stopped use the terminal to remove the container.

# Managing local docker images

In practice, images are either custom-made or downloaded from Docker Hub. Docker Hub is a registry of community-made Docker images. In other words, it's a website from which we can download thousands of pre-made images for all kinds of use cases. For any common use-case, we will find an image on Docker Hub. 

Downloading an image from Docker Hub is called pulling an image.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5736ce31-e073-40cb-830b-ffec61a2b832)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6617be62-7edb-4397-a6f4-51bf4abe1554)

Now that we know how to pull images, we need a way to view the images we have available on our machine.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8434715-4595-4f75-9b2f-d7ed6a9098df)

Docker only has a limited amount of space it can use on our disk. Previously we saw how to remove containers using docker container rm. Similarly, we can use docker image rm to clear space for more containers and images. A container is a running image; a side effect of this is that you can only delete an image once there are no more containers based on it. If we try to delete an image for which we still have a container on our system, we'll get the warning you can see at the bottom of the slide. This error message also includes the container's id based on the image we're trying to remove. We can use the docker container rm command to remove the container, after which we can remove the image.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cf961dd-14b8-430a-b90e-ecb63a0aeda9)

It's common to have multiple containers based on a single image, which can make it a tedious task to one by one remove all containers before you can remove an image. To more easily clear all stopped containers, we can use docker container prune.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67e10704-1815-4d86-bca6-7e6d1ef477c8)

Then we can use docker image prune dash a to remove all unused images. The a flag, which stands for all, makes it so that unused containers are removed and not only dangling images.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/797fe854-70c7-4985-a68f-b7ced28c7edd)

A dangling image is an image that no longer has a name because the name has been re-used for another image. This frequently occurs when creating our own images. For example, if we create an image called testsql, but we find a mistake and change our image slightly, the previous testsql image will then become dangling as our new fixed image now has the testsql name.

## Exercise: Pulling a specific tag

You were helping a colleague by looking at an issue they were having with installing some of their tools on the ubuntu image. You couldn't reproduce the issues so far, and just realized you might be trying on a different version of Ubuntu.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to see all images available on your machine.

    Seems like you are not using the same version as your colleague, who is using the 22.04 tag of ubuntu. Pull the right version, 22.04, of the ubuntu image.

## Solution

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/259858bf-3038-4f4f-a939-2b60c1ad72e2)

## Exercise: Cleaning up images

The project you were working on is done. You had to use and try several docker containers and images and would like to clear up some space on your system before starting your next project. You remember using the ubuntu image last and know you won't need it for your next project.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to remove the ubuntu image.

    The ubuntu image failed to remove since it still has a container using it. To be sure you can clean up your images, remove all stopped containers.

    Now that all stopped containers are removed, also remove all unused images.

# Writing Your Own Docker Images

Once you are able to manage images and containers, it's time to know how to share images with colleagues or your entire company and to understand how to create your own. Now, you'll build your own images using Dockerfiles. Dockerfiles are text files that include everything needed for Docker to build an image. You'll learn how to create images and will get an introduction to all the essential Dockerfile instructions like FROM, RUN, COPY, and more. By the end of this chapter, you'll have insight into how Docker makes images and be able to create optimized Docker images from scratch.

----------------------

In the previous lesson, we learned about the official Docker images registry and how we can pull images from it. This is just one way images are distributed. Now, we will learn how to share images with just a few people or a broader community. Either by sending docker images like we would send any other file or using a Docker registry server.

First, we'll have a look at private Docker registry servers. The Docker organization maintains the official Docker images registry. Other Docker registries work the same way but are under the control of another person or group. This means there are no guarantees that the images will work or are safe to use. Images from any registry other than the one from the official Docker organization are easily recognizable because their name starts with the URL of the private Docker registry they come from. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/494f045a-5512-4074-9987-c34eefb8f28e)

Now that we know how to pull images from a custom registry, let's look at how to upload or push an image to a Docker registry. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90aeecc8-5d4b-47ad-91ca-28817c74e872)

While the Docker official images can be pulled without authentication, anybody creating a private Docker registry can make it private and require authentication. The standard way to secure private Docker registries requires users to log in. We do this with the Docker login command followed by the private registry we want to authenticate for. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fe0524b-7cf4-4ac9-81ed-fae42bee6e08)

If, instead of using a Docker registry, we want to send a Docker image to just a few people, it can be easier to send the image as a file. Use the save command to save a Docker image to a file. This will create a minimized file which we can then share like any other file. We can pass the desired filename to the save command using the minus o flag. To load the file, we use the load command, passing the filename using the minus i flag.

## Exercise: Sharing your work using a Docker registry

Your company is developing a new spam filter method. You think you've found a good method and would like to share your results with your colleague in a way that allows them to verify your results. You've decided that using a Docker image with all your code and datasets is the right approach. You've already created this image on your local machine and called it spam:v1. The next step is to push this image to your company's registry docker.mycompany.com so that your colleagues can build upon your work.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to tag the spam:v1 container so it can be pushed to docker.mycompany.com.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to push the docker.mycompany.com/spam:v1 image to the docker.mycompany.com registry.


## Solution

## Exercise: Saving an image to a file

After you pushed your image to the company's registry, you got a lot of feedback from your colleagues. You addressed the most important feedback and would like to share your new Docker image, spam:v2, with just a few colleagues before you share it with the entire company again. Save your new Docker image to a file called spam_updated.tar so you can email it to your colleagues Alice and Bob.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to save spam:v2 to a file called spam_updated.tar.

## Solution

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/769ebe28-7f56-4e5f-96c0-64ef96587dc2)


## Exercise: Receiving Docker Images

Your company is still working on that new spam filter! Your colleague Bob made possible improvements to your work and sent you a tar file. Another colleague, Alice, has pushed her version to the company's dockerhub, docker.mycompany.com. It's now up to you to run both containers and find out which runs fastest.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to pull the container your colleague Alice made, spam_alice:v3, from the company's Docker Hub registry, docker.mycompany.com.

    Run the container you just pulled, docker.mycompany.com/spam_alice:v3, to see how good its spam detection algorithm is.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to open the tar file your colleague Bob sent you, spam_bob.tar.

    Just like you did for Alice's container, run Bob's container, spam_bob:v3, to see how good its spam detection algorithm is.

## Solution

Now that we know how to work with docker images and containers, it's time to create our own images.
Docker images are the recipes or blueprints for Docker containers. To create this blueprint, we must write down a list of instructions in what is called a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text file containing all the commands we would run in the command line to install the software we need, with the addition of some Docker-specific syntax. Conveniently this file should be called Dockerfile for Docker to be able to find it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/950f72a1-79aa-4c91-beea-7cc2968f050e)

Just like when we would follow a recipe, Docker runs the lines in a Dockerfile from top to bottom. The first line in a Dockerfile is always the FROM instruction. This instruction indicates to Docker which image to start from. We can base our images on any other image, Postgres, Ubuntu, another image you made yourself, or even the hello-world image. As with pulling an image, if you want to start from a specific version, you can specify the version right after the image name, separating both with a colon.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d00969e0-7f97-4cb6-9996-4c48f252d51d)

With the FROM instruction, we can create the most basic Dockerfile; we can then create an image from this Dockerfile using the Docker build command. The docker build command is followed by the location of the Dockerfile we want to build. If our Dockerfile is in the current folder, this is simply a dot. When running Docker build, in the last line of the output, we can see the id or hash docker assigns the new image. The hash starts by indicating its type, sha256, in this case. This is followed by the unique hash, which starts with a67f for the example on the slide.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2b1fbf8-d901-42fd-a7b9-982f4d4e939c)

If we want to give our image a more recognizable name, we can use the t for tag flag followed by the name we want to give our image. If we also want to give a version to our image, we can add a colon and the version after the image name. In both cases we end the docker build command with a dot indicating our Dockerfile is in the current working directory. Once Docker has successfully built our image from our Dockerfile, we can run and use our image just like the images we downloaded from Dockerhub.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73c323ac-396b-4b3f-b26a-cce0cc4cae76)

Now that we can create a very basic image from a Dockerfile, the next step is to start customizing our image. To customize our Dockerfile we will use the RUN instruction. The RUN instruction allows us to run any valid shell command while building an image. To make an image that runs a python data analysis, we start from the ubuntu image, which has Ubuntu installed, by specifying the FROM ubuntu instruction followed by RUN apt-get update. Apt-get is a package manager which enables us to install all kinds of software. The apt-get update command we just added to our Dockerfile will update apt-get so it knows what the most up-to-date version is of all the different software it can install for us. Using another RUN instruction on the following line, we download python using RUN apt-get install python3. Like we can see at the bottom of the slide, some bash commands require user input. While a Docker image is building it is not possible to manually give any input to the bash commands docker runs. Instead we can pass the dash y flag to apt-get install to make sure it doesn't need any input.

## Exercise: Building your first image

Let's build your first image! We've created a Dockerfile for you, and you can see it in your current working directory using the ls command. You can look at its content using cat Dockerfile or using nano.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to build an image from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.

    Well done! While it's possible to build an image without naming it, we usually want to give our image a name. Using the terminal, enter the command to build an image called my_first_image from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.


## Solution

## Exercise: Working in the command-line

A Dockerfile is just a textfile and creating or editing it can be done using any text editor. However since the default way to work with Docker is through the Command Line Interface, it's convenient to also edit Dockerfiles using the command line. Let's refresh our memory on how to navigate the file system and create or edit a Dockerfile with the command line.

    Create a file called Dockerfile in the current working directory.

        Use touch Dockerfile; the touch command will create an empty file for you.
        Or use nano Dockerfile, which will create an empty file but also open the nano text editor, which you then have to save using CTRL+s after which you can exit with CTRL+x.

    Now that you've created a new file let's add a line of text to it.

        Open the file using nano Dockerfile.        
        add FROM ubuntu to the start of the file.        
        Use CTRL+s to save your changes.
        Followed by CTRL+x to exit nano.

    Using nano to edit a file is often the most intuitive way; however, you can also use echo combined with a double pipe (>>) to append to files without opening them. Let's use echo to append RUN apt-get update to our Dockerfile.

        Type the first part of the command, echo "RUN apt-get update" which will print the text between the quotes, don't press enter yet.
        Then add the double pipe >>, which will redirect the output.
        Followed by Dockerfile to make the output of echo append to the Dockerfile.
        Now execute the command by pressing the enter key.


    Well done! You successfully created and made changes to a file. Often while working in the shell, you want to quickly check the contents of a file without making changes to it. This is easily done using the cat command.

        Check the contents of the Dockerfile using the cat command, cat expects a filename as its first and only argument.

## Solution

```bash
$ cat Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
```

## Exercise: Editing a Dockerfile

Let's get familiar with the RUN instruction. We've created a Dockerfile for you. You can look at its content using cat Dockerfile or using nano. Like before, the Dockerfile already has a FROM instruction, but you'll be adding a RUN command this time.

    Add the correct instruction to the end of the Dockerfile so that the mkdir my_app shell command is run when building the Dockerfile.
    Using the terminal, run the command to build an image called my_app from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.

## Solution

## Exercise: Creating your own Dockerfile

While it's possible to download images for many use cases, an image might not always meet your exact needs. In that case, you can create a new image based on an existing one that closely matches your requirements. Let's go through the steps to create a Dockerfile from scratch, build on top of an existing Ubuntu image, add your instructions, and then build it into a new image.

    Create a file called Dockerfile in the current working directory.
    Add the first instruction to the Dockerfile so that it will build on top of the ubuntu image.
    Add instructions to the Dockerfile so that it runs apt-get update and apt-get install -y python3 when building the Dockerfile.
    Using the terminal, run the command to build an image called my_python_image from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.
    

## Solution

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9571276-eaaf-452c-bfd3-28a63052f9ca)

The RUN instruction allowed us to execute bash commands to create an image, but we can't use it to move files from our local file system onto the image we're building. To copy local files to our image we use the COPY instruction. The COPY instruction needs two parameters: first, we pass to it the path of the file we want to copy, including the name of the file we want to copy. The second parameter is the destination path inside the image. We can choose whether to end the destination path with a filename. If we do not pass a filename, the file will get its original name.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/277bbc62-4f84-445c-94c8-2eb0062e3c3e)

If we don't specify a filename in the source path, then instead of just a single file, the entire contents of the folder will be copied, including sub-folders. For example, if we have a folder called pipeline underscore v3 with two files and a sub-folder with one file, we can copy both files and the subfolder with its file using the COPY instruction ending in pipeline v3 slash.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0316414-d8dd-4115-8e5e-92d8cd857dc3)

It is not possible to copy files from a parent directory when building a Dockerfile. For example, let's say we are in the projects folder when we run docker build. A COPY instruction in the Dockerfile that tries to copy the init dot py file from the parent directory of the current directory into the image will fail with the not found message we can see on the slide.

Another common way to include files in an image is to download them during the image build. While there is an instruction that allows us to do this, the ADD instruction, best practice is to use several RUN instructions and bash commands to download and unzip files. First, use curl to download a file to a local directory. Then unzip it using the unzip command if it is an archive. Finally, once we don't need the zip file anymore, we can remove it with the rm command.

Any instruction in a Dockerfile that downloads files will add to the size of the image. Even if the files are removed in a later instruction. To ensure images don't become unnecessarily big, we should download, unzip and remove the original file in a single RUN instruction. This can be done by chaining the commands using a backslash and double ampersand. The backslash makes it so bash commands can span multiple lines allowing us to keep our Dockerfile readable. The double ampersand tells the shell to execute the commands one after the other. Combining them allows us to create a single RUN instruction that is still easy to read over multiple lines. By using this best practice on downloading and unpacking archives, we ensure our image is as small as possible, making it easier to share and faster to run.

## Exercise: Copying files into an image

You've created an Ubuntu and python3-based image to run your data pipeline. Update your Dockerfile so your image includes the pipeline.py file in which you defined the pipeline.

    To the end of the Dockerfile, add the Docker instruction, which copies the pipeline.py file in your current working directory (/home/repl) to the /app folder in the image you want to build.

## Solution

## Exercise: Copying folders

After creating an ubuntu and python3 image with your pipeline python code in it, you realize you actually need your entire pipeline_v3 project in the Docker image to be able to install its dependencies. There is a Dockerfile in the current working directory to start from that already has python3 installed.

    Add the instruction to copy all pipeline_v3 project files into the /app directory in your Docker image. You can find the files in the /pipeline_v3/ directory, which is in the current working directory on your local machine.
    Using the terminal, run the command to build an image called pipeline_v3 from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.

## Solution

```bash
$ cat Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python3
COPY /home/repl/pipeline_v3/ /app
```

## Exercise: Working with downloaded files

Your previous image worked, and you were able to finalize your pipeline python code! You can now create the next version of your image. Let's create a Dockerfile from scratch, add instructions and then build it.

    Create a file called Dockerfile in the current working directory.

    Add the first instruction to the Dockerfile so that it will build on top of the ubuntu image.
    Add instructions to the Dockerfile so that it runs apt-get update and apt-get install -y python3 curl unzip.

    Add instructions to the Dockerfile to:
    Download the zip file from https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/6082/datasets/31a5052c6a5424cbb8d939a7a6eff9311957e7d0/pipeline_final.zip to /pipeline_final.zip.
    Unzip the file
    And remove the zip
    You can use three separate instructions or make it a single instruction to keep your image smaller.

    Using the terminal, run the command to build an image called pipeline from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.

## Solution

```bash
$ cat Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install -y python3 curl unzip
RUN curl https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/6082/datasets/31a5052c6a5424cbb8d939a7a6eff9311957e7d0/pipeline_final.zip -o /pipeline_final.zip
RUN unzip /pipeline_final.zip
RUN rm /pipeline_final.zip
```

Docker images have this flexibility; using the CMD instruction we can choose any shell command to execute when a container is started from the image.

Like everything else we add to images, we can add a start command using an instruction in the Dockerfile. This instruction is CMD. CMD accepts a single parameter, the shell command to run when the image starts. The shell command runs when somebody starts a container; it is not executed when using docker build to create an image from the Dockerfile. Adding a CMD instruction to a Dockerfile does not increase the image size and does not add any time to the build. If multiple CMD instructions exist in a single Dockerfile, then only the last one will have any effect.

When building an image for a specific use, it makes sense to set the CMD instruction to start an application related to this particular use. This could be starting a python based data analysis or starting software like a database that accepts outside connections. Another typical pattern is to run a script at startup that starts multiple other applications.

While the CMD instruction sets a default start command for the image, this default start command can be overridden when starting an image using the Docker run command. Just like we pass the image we want to start to Docker run, we can pass a second optional argument, which will override the CMD instruction set in the image. Often when replacing the start command of an image, we will run the image in interactive mode, using the 'dash it' flag. Using a shell as new start command, for example, bash, allows us to look around the image, discover files and see what's installed.

## Exercise: Overriding the default command

Overriding the start command of an image has many uses. One of them is testing or debugging something in an image that already has a start command with a specific use case. For example, the postgres image starts a database if you start it normally. To be able to dive into the image and look at configuration files or debug an issue you're having; you can start it with the bash command, an often available shell. What is the command to start the postgres image interactively with a bash shell?

## Solution

```bash
docker run -it postgres bash

## bash: This is the command to execute inside the newly created container. It starts a bash shell, providing you with a command-line interface within the container.
```

## Exercise: Pulling a specific tag

You were helping a colleague by looking at an issue they were having with installing some of their tools on the ubuntu image. You couldn't reproduce the issues so far, and just realized you might be trying on a different version of Ubuntu.

    Using the terminal, enter the command to see all images available on your machine.

    Seems like you are not using the same version as your colleague, who is using the 22.04 tag of ubuntu. Pull the right version, 22.04, of the ubuntu image.

## Solution

## Exercise: Adding a CMD

While creating an image for your python pipeline, you had many issues debugging any problems that came up. To be able to debug these easily, you decide to make an image based on the same version of ubuntu that starts python3 by default.

    Add the instruction so that your Docker image starts python3 by default.

    Using the terminal, run the command to build an image called pipeline_debug from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.

    Let's test the image we just made. Using the terminal, enter the command to run the pipeline_debug image.

## Solution

```bash
$ cat Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update 
RUN apt-get -y install -y python3 
CMD python3
```
